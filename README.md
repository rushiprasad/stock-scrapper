Stock Scrapper

You can change stocks name in the stockData.json file that you want to scrap.

On running stockBot.py the code will find stock names from stockData.json to scrap, do mathematical operations on 
the scrapped data and appends the data in the stockDataForWeb.json in JSON format.

Just open the index.php file in your browser, that's it.
